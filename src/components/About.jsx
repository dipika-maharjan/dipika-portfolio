                    Hi, I’m Dipika — an undergraduate student and aspiring front-end developer with a passion for UI/UX design. 
                    I believe great design should feel effortless.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                    I come from a curious and detail-oriented mindset, always striving to create clean, responsive, and user-first interfaces. 
                    I focus on building real projects that combine functionality with beauty. 
                    I value simplicity, empathy, and good design that speaks without shouting.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <h4>My goals?</h4>
                <p>To grow into a developer who not only writes clean code but also understands people behind the screen.</p>
